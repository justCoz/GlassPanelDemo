# GlassPanelDemo
Write on overlapping panels.
The idea was to create a background graphic that did not change and show that behind a custom control based on a formated text field that does change with user interaction.  Used a Java Swing JInternalFrame and wrote the dynamic part to the glass pane.  Wrote the static part to the content pane.  Made the glass pane transparent ( not opaque ).  This works really well.  The final product is a VFO Display Control which is blind accessible, based on the VFO display in JRX by Paul Lutus.  We should have a release in September as the application is working pretty well now.  Give me a call for details, Coz WA3RQD.  I am NCS for MSN on the weekends.
